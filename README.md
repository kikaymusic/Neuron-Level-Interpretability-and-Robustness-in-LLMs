> This framework applies explainability tools and adversarial‐attack techniques to test the robustness of Transformer-based models (LLMs) at the neuron level.

---

## 🚀 Description

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for:
1. **Causal neuron analysis** – locate and quantify the importance of individual neurons in a Transformer classifier.  
2. **Adversarial robustness testing** – launch gradient-based or poisoning attacks against those critical neurons.  
3. **Visualization** – produce human-interpretable reports of neuron behavior and attack outcomes.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Create a Python 3.9 virtual environment**  
    ```bash
   python3.9 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
3. **Replace NeuroX folder**  
    After installation, swap out the original `neurox/` folder in your environment with the `neurox/` directory from this repo.
    
    _(Note: this step will be automated in a future release.)_

## 🔮 Future Work

- **Neuron-Level Defense Mechanisms in Realistic Deployments**  
    Extend adversarial training to the neuron scale, develop lightweight runtime detectors for anomalous activation patterns, derive certified robustness guarantees against neuron tampering, and integrate with operational telemetry (e.g., system-call or network logs).
    
- **Multimodal and Cross-Domain Applications**  
    Evaluate performance-degradation curves across different data modalities to test the generality of the neuron-severity scale and uncover domain-specific vulnerabilities.
    
- **Targeted Misclassification Attacks**  
    Design attacks that mask malware under normal traffic, causing the model to misclassify specific labels without degrading overall performance.
    
- **Interactive Visualization Tooling**  
    Build a web-based front-end to allow practitioners to explore neuron activations, attack effects, and defenses in real time.
    
- **Federated Learning Scenarios**  
    Adapt the pipeline for FL settings, study how non-IID client data and client-level attacks manifest at the neuron level, and compare global vs. local neuron importance metrics under a distributed paradigm.
